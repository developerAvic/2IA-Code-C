## 🧠 How to Use This Repository

- Click on any file to view its source code.
- Each program is self-contained and can be compiled with a standard C compiler (`gcc`/`clang`).

---

## 📌 Notes

- All files are `.c` source files written in plain C.
- The repository name (`FinalLabsC`) indicates its focus on lab exercise implementations in C.

Happy coding! 🎯  
If you want detailed summaries of what each program does *line by line*, just ask — I can generate those too.
